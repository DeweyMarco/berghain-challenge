## üéØ ADVANCED SCORING
**Advanced Score**: 7.996 vs threshold 0.100 (√ó1.5 multi-bonus)

**Score Breakdown:**
- underground_veteran: urgency=0.50, rarity=1.5, contrib=0.74
- international: urgency=0.65, rarity=1.7, contrib=1.13  
- fashion_forward: urgency=0.55, rarity=1.4, contrib=0.80

**Total Contribution**: 2.67

## üîç EXPECTED CATEGORY BREAKDOWN
Based on true probabilities, the population distribution is:
- **All six attributes**: 0.5% (~5 people) - **PLATINUM!**
- **Five attributes**: 4.2% (~42 people) - **GOLD!**
- **Four attributes**: 15.8% (~158 people) - **SILVER!**
- **Three attributes**: 28.9% (~289 people)
- **Two attributes**: 28.7% (~287 people)
- **One attribute**: 17.8% (~178 people)
- **No attributes**: 4.1% (~41 people)

## üéØ STRATEGY IMPLICATIONS
- Need 800 german_speaker people (target: 80% of population) - **CRITICAL PRIORITY**
- Need 650 international people (target: 65% of population) - **HIGH PRIORITY**
- Need 550 fashion_forward people (target: 55% of population) - **HIGH PRIORITY**
- Need 500 underground_veteran people (target: 50% of population) - **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- Need 250 queer_friendly people (target: 25% of population) - **CRITICAL PRIORITY**
- Need 200 vinyl_collector people (target: 20% of population) - **CRITICAL PRIORITY**
- Queer_friendly and vinyl_collector people are extremely rare (only 4.6% and 4.5%) - accept them whenever possible!
- German speakers are also valuable since you need 80% of the venue to speak German

## üéÆ HOW IT WORKS
- People arrive sequentially with binary attributes (underground_veteran, international, fashion_forward, queer_friendly, vinyl_collector, german_speaker)
- You must make immediate accept/reject decisions
- The game ends when either:
  - (a) venue is full (1000 people)
  - (b) you rejected 20,000 people

## üèÜ SCORING
Your score is the number of people you rejected before filling the venue (the less the better).

## üí° KEY INSIGHT
This scenario has critical bottlenecks with queer_friendly and vinyl_collector people (only 4.6% and 4.5% frequency respectively) - you need 250 and 200 of them but they're extremely rare. You'll need to be extremely selective about accepting people who aren't queer_friendly or vinyl_collectors, and prioritize these rare individuals above all else. The high requirements for german_speaker (80%) and international (65%) also make this challenging since you need to balance multiple constraints while ensuring you don't miss the rare queer_friendly and vinyl_collector individuals.
